# The Project Archive

This repository contains the marketing site for The Project Archive, a creative studio based in the Maldives. The site now features individual pages for each key section—About, Mission, Approach, In Numbers, Services, and Contact—linked from a global navigation bar. The Services page also showcases a small photo gallery of past projects.

Install dependencies and start the development server to view the site locally:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This launches [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server) on port 8080. You can also open `index.html` directly in a browser after installing dependencies.
