# The Project Archive

This repository contains the static marketing site for The Project Archive, a creative studio based in the Maldives. The site features individual pages for each key section—About, Mission, Approach, In Numbers, Services, and Contact—linked from a global navigation bar. The Services page also showcases a small photo gallery of past projects.

To view the site locally without any build step, serve the repository root with a simple static server such as Python:

```bash
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
